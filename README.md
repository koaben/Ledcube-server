# Ledcube-server

This is a Java application meant to connect a Led Cube to the "Cloud".

The project actually contains two runnables, a standalone JavaFX application that can interact with the cube via USB, render the Cube on screen and play games.
It can also be deployed as a WAR archive on a JEE container, providing a RESTful interface for the cube.
